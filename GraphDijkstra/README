In my opinion this is a very cool piece of code. Given a list of people and they're neighbors create a graph.

Then you can look at several things in the graph. You can add people, add edges, print the graph, and print people who are N hops away from another person.

This last function is the most interesting because it utilizes the Dijkstra algorithm. This code is found within Graph.cpp "peopleNHopsAway()" if you would like to read it

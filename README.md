# Data-Structures

Hello and welcome to my collection of data structures code!

I have labeled the folders to show which data structures they make use of. However for more detailed explanations of what they're doing within each folder is a README

In the case that the code makes a useful output text I have run the code and placed this text in a file called "output.txt"

If there is a data structure not found in this repository please don't assume I don't know the structure. For this repo I selected just a few of the coolest projects in my opinion.

Thank you for viewing my data structures repo
